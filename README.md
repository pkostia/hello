This is the *__Hello World__* example from the git tutorial - [githowto](https://githowto.com/).

If you want to do this too, you have to install a Git client

Linux | Mac | Windows

`yum install git` | [Git for Mac OS X](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) | [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org//)
`apt-get install git` | `brew install git` |
`zypper in git` |  |
